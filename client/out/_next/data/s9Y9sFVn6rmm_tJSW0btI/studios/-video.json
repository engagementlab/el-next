The Center approaches gun violence as a public health crisis and sees education and community engagement as key components in the effort to tackle this crisis. This is where professor Pak and his students enter the picture. The course offered Emerson’s students an opportunity to learn about gun violence from primary sources. It also created a means to share that knowledge with the public. When the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the Spring 2020 semester, the project was already under way, but the documentaries were far from finished. Completing the documentaries suddenly became more complicated.The pandemic also meant that the medical professionals involved in the project now had more urgent problems to deal with. These challenges did not derail the project, though. Instead, they called for an additional dose of creativity. Professor Pak devised a strategy in which he would shoot a series of socially distanced interviews, then disseminated the footage to his students to collaboratively edit it. In the Fall of 2020 he worked with an editor to complete post-production on all four films.cxhv"}]}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Ωdthfggerdtyhvgrfhjrfdhjtcg jhdrtfcxyhgrsdfyhxc"}]},{"type":"component-block","component":"video","props":{"video":{"label":"Peter McConarty","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/552024838?h=646629ab02","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1140537199-29391740ce11313feb6969a0ab9745520074438bbce052a9024d83bf468621d8-d_1920x1080?r=pad","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1140537199-29391740ce11313feb6969a0ab9745520074438bbce052a9024d83bf468621d8-d_200x150?r=pad"}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}]}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]},"associatedMedia":[{"videos":null},{"videos":[{"label":"People's Collaborative Governance Network","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/658641918?h=f193cf4a2e","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1330118968-c8e7f7b7c4a92e144d999aa0456d899e3e67d6be1e838e1d586cd2202d53fb8f-d_1920x1080?r=pad","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1330118968-c8e7f7b7c4a92e144d999aa0456d899e3e67d6be1e838e1d586cd2202d53fb8f-d_200x150?r=pad","caption":"Lorem Ipsum"}]}]},"relatedItems":[{"name":"Test Studio","key":"test-studio","filters":[{"type":"Semester","name":"Spring 2020"}],"thumbnail":null},{"name":"MGH Partnered Studio","key":"mgh-partnered-studio","filters":[{"type":"Voices","name":"Survivor"},{"type":"Semester","name":"Spring 2021"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl154kooq00002ubgchhuhz8w"}},{"name":" Video","key":"-video","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl16vpepb000020bg5wcx3s79"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
