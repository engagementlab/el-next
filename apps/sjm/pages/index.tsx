            <p>Young storytellers today have power. As our digital ecosystems further polarize our politics and
              splinter our communities, those engaged in creating stories that support positive social change are
              motivated by purpose and presence. Around the world, young people are creating movements to support more
              just and equitable futures. These movements are anchored by narratives that reframe, uplift, and give
              power to those ideas and people on the margins. The Social Justice + Media Symposium was created to bring
              emerging storytellers together to build networks of support, mentorship and collaboration in support of
              equitable civic futures.




              SJ+M annually convenes students, faculty, activists, scholars, and storytellers to explore how media
              pedagogies and practices can support more just and equitable civic futures. The symposium provides space
              for emerging storytellers from universities around the world to create networks that advocate for the
              media and civic systems that best reflect equitable and vibrant societies. Each spring, SJ+M presents the
              transformative media literacy scholar award, which provides support for social justice media projects, and
              access to networks of fellow practitioners and teachers.



              The symposium is in memory of the work and life of Professor Moses Shumow. On October 22, 2019, mediamaker
              and activist Moses Shumow passed away tragically in a train accident outside of Boston, MA. Moses was a
              firm believer in the power of story to reframe narratives of the marginalized. He worked tirelessly in the
              classroom and community, to help people use media to advocate for their rights. His classrooms were
              reflections of this work, and his students gravitated towards his commitment, passion and energy. The
              symposium annually gathers students, faculty, activities, practitioners, and those committed to more
              equitable futures to continue the dialog that was so important to Mosesâ€™s work, and to communities around
              the world.</p>
