They will explore how to tell stories and create experiences in immersive media environments that inspire people to action. The course will involve the direct participation of survivors of gun violence, as co-designers of the media experiences. Students will work on project teams with family members who have lost loved ones to gun violence to create immersive experiences for healing and empowerment. Final projects may be interactive VR or 360 video, depending on the interests and skills of students and partners. This course is being offered as part of the Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence Initiative, so all the media produced in the course will be publicly available on the initiative website where organizations throughout Boston will be encouraged to use them."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Check back throughout the semester for course updates!"}]}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Creators"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"David Kelleher, professor"}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://ldbpeaceinstitute.org","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Peace Institute"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Department"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://emerson.edu/academics/academic-departments/visual-media-arts","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Visual and Media Arts"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Contact"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"david_kelleher@emerson.edu"}]}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}},"relatedItems":[{"name":"VM495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2020)","key":"vm495-documentary-studio-spring-2020","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fdar00015ips34jycc6j"}},{"name":"Co-Creation of VR and 360-Video","key":"co-creation-of-vr-and-360-video","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282eiqr00005ips1hed1wqw"}},{"name":"VM 495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2022)","key":"vm-495-documentary-studio-spring-2022","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fk8700025ipscl4b2z3j"}},{"name":"TH315 Performing Solutions: A Dramatic Approach to Gun Violence Prevention","key":"th315-performing-solutions-a-dramatic-approach-to-gun-violence-prevention","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl4hcap8w0001t4psh8jg9gf4"}},{"name":"VM495: Immersive Media (Fall 2022)","key":"vm495-immersive-media-fall-2022","filters":[{"type":"Semester","name":"Fall 2022"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl6qptyyy0000rwps0dj8eafz"}},{"name":"VM300: Games for Social Change","key":"vm300-games-for-social-change","filters":[{"type":"Department","name":"Visual and Media Arts"},{"type":"Partner","name":"Teen Empowerment"},{"type":"Semester","name":"Fall 2022"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl6qpy4zh0001rwpsdsqi5flj"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
