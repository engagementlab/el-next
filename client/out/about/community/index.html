Still today we see racial disparities in gun-related homicide and police brutality, indicating that BIPOC individuals and communities are still disproportionately impacted by gun violence. Furthermore, stories about gun violence often perpetuate negative stereotypes of BIPOC individuals and communities. It is impossible to address the issue of gun violence and transform harmful narratives without recognizing the historical and on-going effects of racism. We commit to careful, collaborative examination of racism as a root cause of gun violence. We commit to working alongside BIPOC individuals and communities to promote anti-racist narratives, and to create media and art that is anti-racist.</p><p class="text-lg font-extrabold text-purple">
De-politicization &amp; Re-humanization </p><p>Like many issues today, narratives about gun violence are often framed to promote certain political ideals and further political objectives. The politicization of gun violence is often at the expense of those directly impacted. We commit to re-centering human experience and aim to avoid politicization.</p><p class="text-lg font-extrabold text-purple">
Co-creation &amp; Co-design </p><p>We commit to create and design <em>with</em> those who are most impacted by gun violence. This usually means that community participants work directly alongside students in a shared learning and creating space. We value the time, expertise, and agency of individuals closely impacted by gun violence and commit to creating spaces that uplift and empower.</p><p class="text-lg font-extrabold text-purple">
Asset Framing</p><p>Asset framing is about defining people by their assets and aspirations before noting their challenges and deficits. We commit to asset-framing as a model for our co-creation work with Boston communities, focusing on what individuals and communities <em>have, </em>not only what they <em>lack.</em></p></div><div class="container mt-14 mb-24 xl:mt-16 px-4 xl:px-8"><hr class="border-sorbet"/><h2 class="text-xl text-coated font-semibold mt-14 mb-12">Our Community</h2><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row mt-5"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><img id="thumb-0" alt="Thumbnail for person with name &quot;Anna Porter&quot;" style="max-width:300px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,c_crop,g_center,ar_4:3/v1/tngvi/people/cl28e11pf001a5ipsdqpb055u?_a=ATAK9Uk0"/></div><div class="lg:ml-6 w-full lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-coated">Anna Porter</h3><p class="mt-2 mb-8">Administrative Coordinator, Mass General Hospital&#x27;s Center for Gun Violence Prevention</p><p><span class="text-coated font-semibold">What brings you here?</span><br/>When I was in high school, active shooter drills were just becoming common. While I grew up and attended school in a very safe district, I was plagued by anxiety and fear surrounding gun violence due to these drills. Additionally, while gun violence has not taken anyone from my life directly, I continue to meet people who are impacted by it every day. My friend&#x27;s father was murdered by gunshot. A family friend&#x27;s father took his own life by gun. I believe that we need to rethink the way we can mitigate gun violence and make our communities safer. I believe we need to tell the untold stories of gun violence and lift up unheard voices. I believe we need to depoliticize the conversation around guns if anything is going to get better. These reasons mark why I am involved in TNGV. </p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row mt-5"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><img id="thumb-1" alt="Thumbnail for person with name &quot;Carla Sheffield&quot;" style="max-width:300px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,c_crop,g_center,ar_4:3/v1/tngvi/people/cl28bzf3c000e5ipsfw4n7ews?_a=ATAK9Uk0"/></div><div class="lg:ml-6 w-full lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-coated">Carla Sheffield</h3><p class="mt-2 mb-8">Co-Founder / Executive Director, Better Opportunities, Inc</p><p><span class="text-coated font-semibold">What brings you here?</span><br/>Gun violence has changed my whole life and not necessarily for the better.

I recognize the ways that people acquire and use guns in the US as a vicious epidemic that causes such harm and rupture across every community. The dysfunctions in our racist legal, education, criminal justice, health and social services systems in the US have all contributed to the violence in our communities. I am involved in TNGV because I want to be part of a coalition to work to reframe the narratives, stereotypes and misunderstandings that have paved the way for gun violence to get out of control.

I am compelled to transform the narrative of gun violence by lifting up those who are working toward peace.</p><p class="text-green-blue font-semibold">Engaged in remembrance of <!-- -->young people in my neighborhood who have been killed by gun violence<!-- -->.</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row mt-5"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><img id="thumb-13" alt="Thumbnail for person with name &quot;Sabrina Carr&quot;" style="max-width:300px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,c_crop,g_center,ar_4:3/v1/tngvi/people/cl28c6a2h000q5ips5lcgc2ae?_a=ATAK9Uk0"/></div><div class="lg:ml-6 w-full lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-coated">Sabrina Carr</h3><p class="mt-2 mb-8">Student, Emerson College</p><p><span class="text-coated font-semibold">What brings you here?</span><br/>Gun Violence has impacted me because as a student in Elementary, Middle School, and High School, I remember hearing about a countless amount of mass shootings in schools where children my age were innocently murdered. I remember being terrified to go to class and worried that the same thing might happen to me. Being apart of this class has opened my eyes to the amount of lives gun violence can impact. It tears communities and families apart, and I am excited to be apart of a project that can hopefully empower people to be apart of change. </p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row mt-5"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><img id="thumb-14" alt="Thumbnail for person with name &quot;Sharry Li&quot;" style="max-width:300px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,c_crop,g_center,ar_4:3/v1/tngvi/people/cl28c6jtf000r5ipsfjxe2lmz?_a=ATAK9Uk0"/></div><div class="lg:ml-6 w-full lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-coated">Sharry Li</h3><p class="mt-2 mb-8">Thesis Project Graduate Student, Emerson College</p><p><span class="text-coated font-semibold">What brings you here?</span><br/>My thesis project aims to bring more social awareness to college students about gun violence in underprivileged communities in the Greater Boston area. I began this project as a part of the three-year collaborative initiative between Emerson College, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Louis D. Brown Peace Institute. Throughout this project, I have realized a gap between college students’ education and the needs of Greater Boston’s local communities. Thus, my goal for this thesis project is to create a structure/tool to support and assist college students in Boston in anti-gun violence activism.</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row mt-5"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><img id="thumb-15" alt="Thumbnail for person with name &quot;Shaulita Francis&quot;" style="max-width:300px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,c_crop,g_center,ar_4:3/v1/tngvi/people/cl28c6rbz000s5ipsdl837bni?_a=ATAK9Uk0"/></div><div class="lg:ml-6 w-full lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-coated">Shaulita Francis</h3><p class="mt-2 mb-8">Communication and Marketing Manager, Louis D.

While I grew up and attended school in a very safe district, I was plagued by anxiety and fear surrounding gun violence due to these drills. Additionally, while gun violence has not taken anyone from my life directly, I continue to meet people who are impacted by it every day. My friend's father was murdered by gunshot. A family friend's father took his own life by gun. I believe that we need to rethink the way we can mitigate gun violence and make our communities safer.

I recognize the ways that people acquire and use guns in the US as a vicious epidemic that causes such harm and rupture across every community. The dysfunctions in our racist legal, education, criminal justice, health and social services systems in the US have all contributed to the violence in our communities. I am involved in TNGV because I want to be part of a coalition to work to reframe the narratives, stereotypes and misunderstandings that have paved the way for gun violence to get out of control.
