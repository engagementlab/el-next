Still today we see racial disparities in gun-related homicide and police brutality, indicating that BIPOC individuals and communities are still disproportionately impacted by gun violence. Furthermore, stories about gun violence often perpetuate negative stereotypes of BIPOC individuals and communities. It is impossible to address the issue of gun violence and transform harmful narratives without recognizing the historical and on-going effects of racism. We commit to careful, collaborative examination of racism as a root cause of gun violence.

While I grew up and attended school in a very safe district, I was plagued by anxiety and fear surrounding gun violence due to these drills. Additionally, while gun violence has not taken anyone from my life directly, I continue to meet people who are impacted by it every day. My friend's father was murdered by gunshot. A family friend's father took his own life by gun. I believe that we need to rethink the way we can mitigate gun violence and make our communities safer. I believe we need to tell the untold stories of gun violence and lift up unheard voices. I believe we need to depoliticize the conversation around guns if anything is going to get better. These reasons mark why I am involved in TNGV.

I recognize the ways that people acquire and use guns in the US as a vicious epidemic that causes such harm and rupture across every community. The dysfunctions in our racist legal, education, criminal justice, health and social services systems in the US have all contributed to the violence in our communities. I am involved in TNGV because I want to be part of a coalition to work to reframe the narratives, stereotypes and misunderstandings that have paved the way for gun violence to get out of control.
