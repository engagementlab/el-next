The course will involve the direct participation of Boston-area teens with first hand experience of gun violence and violence prevention, as co-designers of games. Students will work on project teams with partnering teens to create games that can be played by organizations or community groups in Boston to reframe violence in our communities and advocate for peace. Games can be analog or digital, depending on the interests and skills of students and partners. This course is being offered as part of the Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence Initiative, so all the games produced in the course will be publicly available on the initiative website."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Check back throughout the semester for course updates!"}]}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Creators"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Eric Gordon, professor"}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://teenempowerment.org","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Teen Empowerment"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Department"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://emerson.edu/academics/academic-departments/visual-media-arts","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Visual and Media Arts"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Contact"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"eric_gordon@emerson.edu"}]}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}},"relatedItems":[{"name":"VM495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2020)","key":"vm495-documentary-studio-spring-2020","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fdar00015ips34jycc6j"}},{"name":"Co-Creation of VR and 360-Video","key":"co-creation-of-vr-and-360-video","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282eiqr00005ips1hed1wqw"}},{"name":"VM 495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2022)","key":"vm-495-documentary-studio-spring-2022","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fk8700025ipscl4b2z3j"}},{"name":"TH315 Performing Solutions: A Dramatic Approach to Gun Violence Prevention","key":"th315-performing-solutions-a-dramatic-approach-to-gun-violence-prevention","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl4hcap8w0001t4psh8jg9gf4"}},{"name":"VM495: Immersive Media (Fall 2022)","key":"vm495-immersive-media-fall-2022","filters":[{"type":"Semester","name":"Fall 2022"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl6qptyyy0000rwps0dj8eafz"}},{"name":"VM300: Games for Social Change","key":"vm300-games-for-social-change","filters":[{"type":"Department","name":"Visual and Media Arts"},{"type":"Partner","name":"Teen Empowerment"},{"type":"Semester","name":"Fall 2022"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl6qpy4zh0001rwpsdsqi5flj"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
