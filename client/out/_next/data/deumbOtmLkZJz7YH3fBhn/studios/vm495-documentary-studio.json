The Center approaches gun violence as a public health crisis and sees education and community engagement as key components in the effort to tackle this crisis. This is where professor Pak and his students enter the picture. The course offered Emerson’s students an opportunity to learn about gun violence from primary sources. It also created a means to share that knowledge with the public. When the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the Spring 2020 semester, the project was already under way, but the documentaries were far from finished. Completing the documentaries suddenly became more complicated.The pandemic also meant that the medical professionals involved in the project now had more urgent problems to deal with. These challenges did not derail the project, though. Instead, they called for an additional dose of creativity. Professor Pak devised a strategy in which he would shoot a series of socially distanced interviews, then disseminated the footage to his students to collaboratively edit it. In the Fall of 2020 he worked with an editor to complete post-production on all four films."}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Documentary Filmmaking and Community Engagement"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Documentary makers form relationships with the people they interview. They must earn the trust of their subjects. In this course, the process of making the documentaries became itself a way of engaging with the communities and individuals impacted by gun violence. Five people were interviewed, andfour of the interviews ended up being used to create five-to-six-minute documentaries.Each documentary focuses on the testimony of one particular individual. All four subjects in the documentaries share harrowing stories of pain and loss. But their testimonies tell us a great deal about courage and resilience as well. Together they help us understand how gun violence impacts the lives of different people. They also draw attention to a problem we must face collectively."}]},{"type":"component-block","props":{"image":{"id":"cl28dbbki38975ipsqj9hci8z","label":"Collectively","data":{"imageName":"Collectively","altText":"A group of people with their hands together in the middle.","image":{"publicUrlTransformed":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1650507102/tngvi/cl28dbb7200175ips6tfacygb.jpg","publicId":"tngvi/cl28dbb7200175ips6tfacygb"}}}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}],"component":"image"}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Creators"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Peter Doran, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Gail Hiller, collaborator"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Fanghan Liu, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Peter McConarty, collaborator"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Jack Palermo, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Maia Sperber, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Chris Tapia, collaborator"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Clarissa Turner, collaborator"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Vedaaya Wadhwani, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Ian Zigel, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Jong Ougie Pak, professor"}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Partners"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.massgeneral.org/gun-violence-prevention","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Mass General Hospital"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://ldbpeaceinstitute.org","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Peace Institute"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Department"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic-departments/visual-media-arts","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Visual and Media Arts"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Contact"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"ougie_pak@emerson.edu"}]}]}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Studio Outcomes"}]},{"type":"layout","layout":[2,1],"children":[{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"component-block","props":{"video":{"label":"Gail Hiller","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1140537394-a88dc93753894cd076e635c602a50d307e8745f819080cae4596c555e7b0232f-d_1920x1080?r=pad","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/552024803?h=68fddaa28d","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1140537394-a88dc93753894cd076e635c602a50d307e8745f819080cae4596c555e7b0232f-d_200x150?r=pad"}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}],"component":"video"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"“When your child dies, you’re still a parent.
